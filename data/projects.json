Since streaming has yet to pay the bills, I ask my supporters to help me cover this trip as proof that I can monetize my work. I recently won a “Submit Your Music” competition to open for Mark Battles, an internationally touring rapper and producer from Indiana. On Tuesday evening, October 14th, I’ll perform a 15-minute set in front of many new faces, a once-in-a-lifetime chance to share my music and message. I plan to film the experience and bring everyone along for the ride. Thanks again for your contributions to my independent artistry!",
