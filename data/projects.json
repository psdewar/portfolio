Recently, I won a “Submit Your Music” competition to open for Mark Battles, an internationally touring rapper and producer from Indiana. On Tuesday evening, October 14th, I’ll be in Boise, Idaho to perform a 15-minute set in front of many new faces, a once-in-a-lifetime chance to share my music and message. Since streaming doesn't pay the bills, I ask my supporters to help cover my trip there. Funds cover the round trip, a room, and meals. I plan to film the experience and bring everyone along for the ride. Thanks again for your contributions to my independence as an artist!",
